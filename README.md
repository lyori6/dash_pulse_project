# DashPulse - DoorDash Post-Order UX Prototype

> An interactive prototype showcasing a concept to improve DoorDash's post-order experience through proactive transparency.

## Overview

This project is an interactive website prototype built using **Lovable AI**. It demonstrates **DashPulse V1**, a proposed feature enhancement for the DoorDash mobile app, focusing specifically on the post-order tracking experience.

## Context

This prototype was developed as part of a Product Management interview process (for SimpleClosure) using a hypothetical DoorDash case study. The core challenge was to address significant user anxiety and frustration stemming from **delivery time uncertainty and lack of proactive communication** during the post-order wait â€“ identified as the #1 pain point in research based on public data.

DashPulse V1 aims to mitigate this by providing:
*   More realistic **Dynamic ETA ranges**.
*   **Proactive, contextual updates** directly within the tracking screen when delays occur.

**Note:** This is purely a conceptual prototype for demonstration purposes and is not affiliated with DoorDash.

## Features Demonstrated

The prototype showcases the following key UI states and concepts:

*   **Normal Order Tracking:** Displays ETA as a range and passive "DashPulse Active" status.
*   **Minor Delay Scenario:** Shows a non-intrusive banner with contextual information (e.g., "Restaurant Busy") and updated ETA range.
*   **Significant Delay Scenario:** Shows a distinct banner for more severe delays with updated ETA range.
*   **A/B Test Concept:** Illustrates a variation with a contextual "Need Help?" button appearing during significant delays.
*   **(Optional - Link to Appendix Section)** Additional states like initial confirmation, update log view, post-delivery summary, and a V2 concept.

## Technology

*   **Prototyping Platform:** [Lovable AI](https://lovable.ai/)
*   **Design Concepts:** Inspired by DoorDash UI, created using high-level mockups/wireframes (see Presentation Deck).
*   **Logo:** Custom concept logo (`mylogo.svg` / PNG provided).

## Status

*   **Conceptual Prototype:** This project demonstrates a proposed user experience flow. It is not a fully functional application or official DoorDash feature.
*   **Illustrative Data:** Any data shown (ETAs, costs, ROI in linked presentation) is illustrative and based on assumptions derived from research for the case study.
